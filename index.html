      <h3>Thoughts on the experience</h3>
      <p>Module 1 was was a great challenge to me, I struggled for every project
         and assignment. It was also the most rewarding academic trial I have
         ever had the joy of experiencing. I look forward to continuing to grow
         as a programmer and learning many new skills. I am better prepared for
         the challenged Mod 2 shall bring.

      <h3>Favourite Technical Concept</h3>
      <p>
        I had the joy of joing the Armstrong Posse and learning all about Blockchain technology.
        After attending 3 of the spikes held on the topic I am still very unclear on the specifics
        of the technology. However I do have a rudimentary grasp of how they work and what they can
        achieve. I found the topic so interesting that I even invested in some Crypto-Currency that
        the posse leaders thought would be worth a lot of money some day. After investing $42 to buy
        a single "Ether" at the beginning of March, I have seen my investment rise in value a whopping
        $40 in only 2 months. That's nearly a growth rate of 100%.
